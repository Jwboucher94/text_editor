Python Text Editor

This is just a simple text editing program I'm working on in python. kind of completely useless given the terminals editing abilities as is, but it's a relatively simple command line to use. More options will be added with later releases.

Upon starting, you'll be asked to enter a folder name based on folders in current directory. There's no safeguards yet for miss types or folders that don't exist.

After, you'll be given the option to choose between 1 and 3, create, append, or read. after choosing an option, it will request a file name. if the file does not exist (unless create) it will make a new file with that name.
