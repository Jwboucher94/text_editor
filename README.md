Python Text Editor

This is just a simple text editing program I'm working on in python. kind of completely useless given the terminals editing abilities as is, but it's a relatively simple command line to use. More options will be added with later releases.

Upon starting, you'll be asked to enter a folder name based on folders in current directory. You may create new folders if your folder selection does not exist, or enter a subfolder or previous folder. It will show you your current path and your parent path. 

After, you'll be given the option to choose between 1 and 4, create, append, read, or change folder. after choosing an option, it will request a file name (except for change folder). if the file does not exist it will make a new file with that name.
